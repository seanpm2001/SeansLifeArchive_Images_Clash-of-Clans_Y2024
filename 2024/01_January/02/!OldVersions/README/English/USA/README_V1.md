# 2024, Tuesday, January 2nd - Didn't play

I didn't play Clash of Clans today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on 2020 Saturday, October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the next time slot, which is Sunday. I will be playing again on 2024, Sunday, January 7th.
